## vPool Redesign
-

CSS for the design uses LESS, compiling Bootstrap, Font Awesome and required mixins into a single, minified CSS file.

The design is fully responsive and works on mobile devices, tablets and desktop browsers.

The wallet address checks would be incorporated into the litechecker.php and dogechecker.php files on the server, obviously by themseleves they would be rendered incorrectly, but when used in conjunction with the main page and it's own CSS rules, would render fine.
